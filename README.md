# HTML Colour App

This is version 2.0 of a practice project from [Dave Gray's React Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6PrE9srvEn8nbhOOyxnWXfp).

## MVP

The purpose was to practice techniques learned from the previous 9 videos in the playlist, including:

- Function Components
- CSS Styles
- useState
- Pros
- Controlled Inputs

Users would be able to enter a HTML color name in the input field, then the color would display in the box with the color name.

## Version 2.0

I had fun coding the first version, so I played around an eventually broke it. ðŸ˜† I had wanted to display a gradient in the box when the page initially loaded.
